# Crypto Portfolio Manager

Welcome to the Crypto Portfolio Manager! ðŸš€ Manage your crypto investments in a fun and interactive way. Buy, sell, and track the performance of your favorite cryptocurrencies.

## About the Code:

This Crypto Portfolio Manager is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinCap API to provide live price updates and historical charts. The code is organized into different modules for clarity and maintainability:

- **User Module:** Manages user data such as name, available funds, and cryptocurrency holdings. User information is stored in local storage for a persistent experience across sessions.

- **Data Fetching Module:** Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve cryptocurrency data from the CoinCap API. The data is then processed and rendered in the user interface.

- **Chart Rendering Module:** Dynamically creates and updates interactive charts based on the selected cryptocurrency and time frame. The charts are drawn on an HTML canvas element, providing a visual representation of price trends.

- **User Interface Module:** Handles the rendering of the user interface components, including the cryptocurrency list, individual coin details, and the user's portfolio overview.

- **Sorting and Filtering Module:** Implements sorting options for the cryptocurrency list based on price, 24-hour change, and other criteria. Users can easily customize their view to focus on specific metrics.

- **User Interaction Module:** Manages user interactions such as buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The application dynamically updates the user's portfolio and available funds.
